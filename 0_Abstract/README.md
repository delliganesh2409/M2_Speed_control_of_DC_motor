The speed control mechanism is applicable in many cases like controlling the movement of robotic vehicles, movement of motors in paper mills and the movement of motors in elevators where different types of DC motors are used. Speed control of  DC motor is one of the most useful features of the motor.The DC motor is the motor which converts the direct current into the mechanical work. It works on the principle of Lorentz Law, which states that the current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic and electric field experience a force.
